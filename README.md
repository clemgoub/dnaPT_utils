# dnaPT_utils

dnaPT_utils is a collection of scripts to perform multiple downstream analyses with [dnaPipeTE 1.3](https://github.com/clemgoub/dnaPipeTE)
I recommend to use this tools to replace the graphs automatically produced by the pipeline.

- `dnaPT_charts.sh`: plots the relative repeats' proportions (2 piecharts) and the quantification of each assembled repeat (barplot).
- `dnaPT_landscapes.sh`: plots an histogram representing the blastn divergence mesured between each read and the assembled repeats.
- `dnaPT_compare.sh`: perform a comparative analysis of the relative abundance of shared repeat families between two datasets.

## dnaPT_charts.sh

This script processes an output folder of dnaPipeTE v1.3 and produces 3 graphs:
- Piechart 1 (left): relative proportions of the different repeat categories.
- Piechart 2 (right): proportion of the different repeat categories relative to the total genome.
- Barplot (bottom): genomic proportion of each dnaPipeTE contig and the associated classification.
	- A threshold `-t` (% genome) can be set such as contigs representing < t% of the genome will be groupped together.

> *You will note that the piecharts may provide slightly different values than originaly. Indeed, the piechart directly available after a dnaPipeTE run is based on the counts of 2 successive blastn again (1) the classified repeats in `Trinity.fasta` and (2) the unclassified ones (these counts can be found in `Counts.txt`). This was originaly designed to increase sensitivity at the subclass level. However, it turns out to be confusing without providing  substantial improvement. With this script, the piecharts are now directly made from the results of one single blastn of the reads against the whole `Trinity.fasta` file, which is also used to create the detailed count table `reads_per_components_and_annotation` as well as the landscape analysis.*

### Dependencies:
- `R` + packages `ggplot2`, `tidyverse` and `cowplot` (https://www.r-bloggers.com/2010/11/installing-r-packages/)

### Usage: 

```
./dnaPT_charts.sh -I <dataset_directory> [options]


mendatory arguments:
 -I, --input-dir              dnaPipeTE output directory

options:
 -p, --prefix                 prefix to append to the output filename: "<prefix>_charts.pdf"
 -t, --percent_threshold      barplot: repeats < -t % are groupped together as a single category (default 0.001%)
 -o, --output                 output folder (path); default: dnaPipeTE output directory
 -y, --ylim                   Max value for the y axis (genome %) [0-100]
 -h, --help                   Prints this message and exit
 ```

## dnaPT_landscapes.sh

This script perform at "TE landscape" analysis, i.e., it plots an histogram of the blastn divergence between raw reads (TE copies in the genomes) and their consensus sequences assembled in the file `Trinity.fasta`. The script plots only putative TE sequences among the subclasses "LINE", "SINE", "LTR", "DNA", "RC" and "Unknown" (a.k.a. "NA"). 

### Dependencies:
- R + packages `ggplot2` and `tidyr`

```
   Usage: ./dnaPT_landscape.sh -I <dataset_directory> [options]

   mendatory arguments:
    -I, --input-dir              dnaPipeTE output directory

   options:
    -p, --prefix                 prefix to append to the output filename: "<prefix>_landscapes.pdf"
    -o, --output                 output folder (path); default: dnaPipeTE output directory
    -S, --superfamily            Plot with superfamily information (instead of subclass)
    -y, --ylim                   Max value for the y axis (genome %) [0-100]
    -U, --no-unknown             Remove unclassified repeats
    -h, --help                   Prints this message and exit
```
